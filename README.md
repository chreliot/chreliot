I research and teach philosophy of science at Hofstra University in New York, USA. I offer courses on areas including scientific reasoning, philosophy of biology, and symbolic logic.

I am also an Editor of *Philosophy, Theory, and Practice in Biology* (*PTPBio*). It is a free-to-authors, free-to-readers, scholarly, open access, CC:BY-licensed, library-published academic journal publishing philosophy of biology, biologists' analyses of theory and practice, and a range of allied scholars.
